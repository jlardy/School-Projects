# Agent Based Modeling

Each of these python scripts is a different agent based model. 


## SIR_Model.py  

Very basic disease model that lets you model the spread of a disease on a network of agents. You can set the probability of the disease spreading, the number of agents on the network, the randomness of the network, the connectivity of the network, as well as some initial conditions for the starting number of infected agents as well as the starting number of vaccinated agents. 

## predator_Prey_Model.py 

Model that shows the interaction between 3 species, "grass", "rabbits" and "wolves." This model shows the carrying capacity of a lanscape with input parameters. You can set the initial population sizes and how large the landscape is. 

## random_Social_Networks.py

Simple model that can create a random socail network. You can specify how many nodes you want, the overall degree of the network, as well as how random you want your graph to be on a scale from 0 to 1. 

## ring_World.py

This model shows the emergent behavior of simple agents clustering when placed on a circular network. Each agent is given a vision and moves to a location that is within their vision range that contains the most "sugar", and harvest that sugar.
