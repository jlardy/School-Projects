# Stats.py

This project looks into the effects of COVID-19 on atmospheric greenhouse gases using basic statistics. A regression is built for each each month with all of the recorded data and then detrends the recorded observations using the predicted values. Running the stats.py file will produce a folder for each greenhouse gas containing some simple charts as well as some basic statistics. 

It was discovered that there was no significant decrease in the recorded globally averaged atmospheric greenhouse gases with the data availiable at the time of this project. 

## Data Source
The data that is provided with this repository is the globally averaged trends of various greenhouse gases.
